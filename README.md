**Write SQL queries to answer the following questions about a PostgreSQL database which contains the logs of a fictional newspaper’s website.**
1. What are the most popular three articles of all time?
2. Who are the most popular article authors of all time?
3. On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors?

**Required Libraries and Dependencies**
The project code was created using the following software:
* Python 3.7.2
* psycopg2 2.7.7
* PostgreSQL 9.5.14

View utilized in the file are included in the python file itself, but are also included here for reference:
```sql 
CREATE view comboT AS
SELECT articles.title, articles.slug, authors.name, authors.id, log.time::date as date
FROM articles, authors, log WHERE log.path = '/article/' || articles.slug and articles.author = authors.id;
```     
```sql 
CREATE view page_views AS 
SELECT count(*) AS page_views, time::date AS date 
FROM log WHERE status = '200 OK' GROUP BY date;
```
```sql
CREATE VIEW errors AS SELECT count(*) AS errors, time::date AS date 
FROM log WHERE status != '200 OK' GROUP BY date ORDER BY count(*) DESC;
```               
```sql
CREATE VIEW fail_rate AS SELECT round((errors.errors*1.0/(page_views.page_views+errors.errors)*100, 1) 
AS percent_errors, errors.date 
FROM errors, page_views WHERE errors.date = page_views.date;
```
This project can be run in a Vagrant managed virtual machine (VM). For this project, Vagrant and VirtualBox software were installed on the system.

**Project contents**
* Logs_Analysis_final.py - This the Python program that connects to the PostgreSQL database (‘news’), executes several queries and displays the desired results.
* newsdata.zip - Zip file with the data that populates the PostgreSQL database named 'news'.
* README.md - Contains info about the project (also, what you’re currently reading).
* Vagrantfile - This is the configuration file for the Vagrant virtual machine.

**How to Run the Project**
Download the project zip file to your computer and unzip the file to your desired project directory.
Open the text-based interface for your operating system (terminal window, command prompt, Git Bash, etc ….) and navigate to the project directory.

**Bringing the VM up**
Open your terminal and navigate to the folder containing the Vagrant file.  Then bring up the Virtual Machine (VM) with the following command:

`vagrant up`

then

`vagrant ssh`

Once inside the VM, navigate to the /vagrant directory using the command:

`cd /vagrant`

First, unzip the zip file with the command:

`unzip newsdata.zip`

Then run the following command to load the logs into the database:

`psql -d news -f newsdata.sql`

**Running the reporting tool**

The logs reporting tool is executed with the following command:

`python logs_analysis_final.py`

The answers to the three questions should now be displayed.

**Shutting the virtual machine down**
When you are finished with the project,  press Ctrl-D to log out of it. You can shut down the virtual machine by typing this command:

`vagrant halt`

You should see something akin to 

*“Attempting graceful shutdown of VM…”* 

in your terminal.  Once this process finishes, it will be safe to shut down the terminal without leaving the virtual machine to run in the background forever and ever.
